With vlc-bittorrent, you can open a **.torrent** file or **magnet link** with VLC and stream any media that it contains.

## FAQ

### Does it upload/share/seed while playing?

Yes. It works as a regular Bittorrent client. It will upload as long as it's playing.

### Does it work on Ubuntu/Debian?

Yes!

### Does it work on Windows, Mac OS X, Android, Windows RT, iOS, my toaster?

Probably. I have not tested. It should run since libtorrent works on most systems and the plugin is just standard C and C++. Patches are welcome.

## Dependencies (on Linux)

* libtorrent ("libtorrent-rasterbar9" in Ubuntu 18.04)

## Building from git on a recent Debian/Ubuntu

    $ sudo apt-get install autoconf automake libtool make libvlccore-dev libtorrent-rasterbar-dev g++
    
**NOTE:** In case of Debian 9+ you have to install additional package `libvlc-dev`
    
    $ git clone https://github.com/johang/vlc-bittorrent.git vlc-bittorrent
    $ cd vlc-bittorrent
    $ autoreconf -i
    $ ./configure --prefix=/tmp/vlc
    $ make
    $ make install

Then, to load it in VLC player:

    $ VLC_PLUGIN_PATH=/tmp/vlc/lib vlc --no-plugins-cache video.torrent
